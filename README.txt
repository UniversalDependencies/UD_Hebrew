Universal Dependencies - Hebrew Dependency Treebank (v1)
https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Hebrew

A Universal Dependencies Corpus for Hebrew.

The corpus was built by semi-automatic conversion of the
Hebrew Constituency Treebank (v2).

STRUCTURE

This directory contains a corpus of sentences annotated using Universal Dependencies annotation.
The corpus comprises 115,535 tokens (158,855 words) and 6,216 sentences, taken from the `Ha'aretz` newspaper.
The trees were manually annotated into phrase-structure trees, and then semi-automatically converted
into Universal Dependencies.

This file is compatible with the CoNLL-U format defined for Universal Dependencies. See:
http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html . However, at present the files do not
include lemmas for words. These may be added in a later release.

The dependency taxonomy can be found on the Universal Dependencies web site:

    http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/
    http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/#language-he

The Train/Dev/Test split follows previous splits of the underlying Treebank, namely:
sentences 0-483 dev, 484-5724 train, 5725-6216 test.

Some parts of the structure are more reliable than others. In particular, words with a "morphological feature"
entry of HebSource=ConvUncertainHead or HebSource=ConvUncertainLabel indicate that the head (label) information
for this token is based on unreliable information.
